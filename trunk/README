Description
===============

keploy is a utility to distribute and remove your public ssh key to a single
or large number of systems with the least amount of effort possible.

Usage
===============

* To deploy your default public key (~/.ssh/{id_rsa,id_dsa,identity}.pub) to all
  hosts in your known_hosts file:
     # keploy -k

* To deploy your default pulic key to host remote.host.com:
     # kepoy remote.host.com

* To deploy your default pulic key to host remote.host.com and auto accept
  the ssh public key:
     # kepoy -y remote.host.com

* To deploy your default public key to remote.host.com as user bob and
  enable Agent Forwarding:
     # keploy -A --user=bob remote.host.com

* To replace your old key (now ~/.ssh/id_rsa.old.pub) with your new default 
  public key onto all hosts in the file "~/myhosts":
     # keploy -c ~/.ssh/id_rsa.old.pub -f ~/myhosts

* Remove your public key from all boxes in your known_hosts file,
  and turn off Agent Forwarding:
     # keploy -r -k -A
